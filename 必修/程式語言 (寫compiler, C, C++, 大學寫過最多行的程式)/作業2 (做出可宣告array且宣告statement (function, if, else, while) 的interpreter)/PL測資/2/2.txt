當測試「Test case 2 of 3」時，Input為>>2
     string
     sss;
    int  
   x  
 
   ;   
 x=  
   
    10;

    cout 
    <<   
x 

   ;   

    int  
   y  
 
   ;   
int z ;

x =y+z
- 2*x;
3

   -z;   

int w ;   

 w   
  ++;
   Done
  (    
    )    
    ;   int y = 5 ;
cout << y ;  
<<

正確的輸出應該是>>Our-C running ...
> Definition of sss entered ...
> Definition of x entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of y entered ...
> Definition of z entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of w entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Our-C exited ...<<

你的程式的輸出是>>
